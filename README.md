Library for the ESP8266 on Arduino IDE displaying text on multiple 8x8 led matrices

This library leds you display text and set specific pixels on multiple 8x8 led matrices with a MAX7219 driver chip controlled through the SPI interface.
  These modules are relatively cheep and can be daisy chained which makes it easy to get a led text bar up and running
  You can find modules here: http://www.banggood.com/2Pcs-MAX7219-Dot-Matrix-MCU-LED-Display-Control-Module-Kit-For-Arduino-p-945280.html?p=0P21061109440201501M (<-Affiliate link)
  
  Currently you can set pixels, write text with a simple font and scroll it left or right or have it oscillate between the two ends.

```  
#include <SPI.h>
#include "LedMatrix.h"

LedMatrix ledMatrix;
#define NUMBER_OF_DEVICES 2 // how many devices have you daisy chained?
#define CS_PIN 2 // on which pin the CS slave is connected?

  
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200); // For debugging output
  ledMatrix.init(NUMBER_OF_DEVICES, CS_PIN); // Initialize the class

  ledMatrix.setText("MAX7219 Demo"); // set the text
}

void loop() {

  ledMatrix.clear();
  ledMatrix.scrollTextLeft();
  ledMatrix.drawText();
  ledMatrix.commit(); // commit transfers the byte buffer to the displays
  delay(200);
}
```
